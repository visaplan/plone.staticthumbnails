visaplan.PACKAGE
=====================

Tell me what your product does

The purpose of this package is *not* to provide new functionality
but to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.
Thus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development
(as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
alternatives in standard Plone components).
